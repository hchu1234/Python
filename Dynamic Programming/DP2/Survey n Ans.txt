Q1

1.2,3) I wasn't able to do Knapsack for bottom up. I tried to tackle the problem in different way, flatten it to 0/1 and similar method I had for top down problem.

1.3) Yes, floating point number will still work for my solution. Because I never used number of items and other information as an array index.

Q3

top down is about 5 times faster when both input is the same.
a = a*100
b = a
Top = 101
0.0160000324249
Bottom = 10201
0.0309998989105


Bottom up is about 5 times faster when the result is No CLS
a = 'a'*100
b = 'b'*100
