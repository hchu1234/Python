what are the complexities of a) and b)?
Binary O(VlogV + E Log V)

Array O(V*V+E)

Also, construct a graph where array is twice as fast as binary heap,
and another graph where binary heap is twice as fast as array.
These graphs should be non-trivial (V>=10); same below.
A graph with 10 + node and each node connect to one other node. ( A simple path)


B ) What is the complexity?
O(ELog V)


C ) What is the complexity?
O (V log V + E log V)

Accoring to the Algorithm, Any complete graph ( All node connected to all other node) will give Prim a lot  better result than Kruskal
